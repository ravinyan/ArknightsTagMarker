# ArknightsTagMarker

Application that marks all 4* and 5* tag results from recruitment. Works for LDPlayer window (can change process name to something else but i have no clue if it will work properly) and bigger window = better OCR accuracy (if window is too small it wont work at all).

It creates window with 4* and 5* results next to the recruitment permit and a small button to easily close the app.


man im not memorizing all these tags are you kidding me im too lazy for that
